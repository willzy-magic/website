        <h2 data-aos="fade-up" class="featurette-heading aos-init" style="padding-top: 2rem;">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this project is to investigate the
            usability issues of the Evo app and redesign the interface, which will make a meaningful impact
            on the user experience. Currently, the lack of information transparency in cost and customer
            support may lead to confusion and overwhelm for inexperienced users. As driving has already
            been a source of pressure for many drivers (Meyer, 2022), redesigning the Evo app interface
            could potentially help Evo users to reduce the psychological burden of using the app while they
            are on the road and further improve their driving experience.</p>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up" class="featurette-heading aos-init" style="padding-top: 2rem;">Mission Statement</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" class="aos-init">Evo Car Share does not have their own mission or vision statement. As a
            product and service
            owned by BCAA, Evo is aligned with BCAA’s values and goals. Given BCAA’s purpose of
            “empowering British Columbians to move forward” and mission of “inspiring every British
            Columbian to be a member” (BCAA, n.d.), our team concluded the Evo Car Share’s mission
            statement as follows:</p>
        <h5 data-aos="fade-up" style="text-align: center" class="aos-init">“To develop a shared transport network of
            flexibility and sustainability for British
            Columbians to get around with confidence.”</h5>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up" class="featurette-heading aos-init" style="padding-top: 2rem;">Goals and Objectives</h2>

        <div data-aos="fade-up" style="padding-top: 2rem;" class="aos-init">
            <li>Convert potential users to loyal Evo users</li>
            <li>Enable users to find and access a car anytime</li>
            <li>Offer users the flexibility of short-term car rental</li>
            <li>Encourage users to move around with a hybrid vehicle</li>
            <li>Enable users to make or cancel reservations</li>
            <li>Enable users to unlock the doors and start the trip with the click of a button</li>
            <li>Enable users to track the trip progress</li>
            <li>Provide users with increased ease of access to parking facilities</li>
            <li>Enable users to make a stopover or end the trip</li>
            <li>Support users when they are in need of assistance through 24/7 customer service line and
                in-app FAQs</li>
            <li>Allow users to return the car at a different location</li>
        </div>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-up" class="featurette-heading aos-init" style="padding-top: 2rem;">Major Stakeholders</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" class="aos-init"> The major stakeholders we identified are end users, Evo management and
            operations team,
            BCAA, and local government.</p>
        <div data-aos="fade-up" class="aos-init">
            <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Primary Users</h6>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" class="aos-init">By definition, end users are the people who actually use the product
                and service. Evo’s end users
                include but are not limited to potential users or likely car-sharing customers who would like to
                rent a vehicle for a short time period, infrequent Evo users who use Evo’s cars for transport with
                a low reuse rate, and frequent or loyal Evo users who have used the services for a long period of
                time. As required by Evo, users need to be at least 18 years old, have a credit card, a valid
                driver's license, 2 years of driving experience, and meet the driving requirement verified by the
                driving record check in order to become an Evo member (Evo, n.d.-a). Evo users heavily rely on
                the app to pick up and drop off their vehicles. They pay either hourly or daily rates to Evo in
                exchange for the temporary possession of the vehicle.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-aos="fade-up" class="aos-init">
            <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Vulog</h6>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" class="aos-init">Vulog is a technology provider for shared mobility solutions,
                including car sharing, bike sharing,
                scooter sharing, and all forms of corporate transportation rental. Vulog’s mission is to “make a
                positive impact on the planet via technological innovations that revolutionize mobility” (Vulog,
                n.d.). Vulog works as a product development and operations team that helps to build the Evo app
                as well as Evo’s in-car technology solutions like GPS tracking.</p>

        <div data-aos="fade-up" class="aos-init">
            <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">British Columbia Automobile Association</h6>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" class="aos-init">BCAA is the parent company and direct investor of Evo Car Share. BCAA
                offers auto-related
                products and services, including car insurance, roadside assistance, auto repair, and Evo Car
                Share. As one of the product offerings, Evo supports BCAA’s goal of “empowering British
                Columbians to move forward” and their belief in “protecting our home” and “shaping the future”
                through revolutionary hybrid vehicles with a roof-top bike rack.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-aos="fade-up" class="aos-init">
            <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Local Government</h6>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" class="aos-init">Evo Car Share works closely with local governments like the City of
                Vancouver to fill the market
                gap of carsharing demands from high urban population density and achieve the goal of
                sustainable transportation. Convenience around accessing and parking Evo vehicles creates a
                focal point in product marketing and gains the popularity of the service among young,
                environmentally conscious people. The city governments help to make designated Evo parking
                spaces possible, giving users the flexibility of returning an Evo car in any approved spot in
                Metro Vancouver.</p>

        <h2 data-aos="fade-up" class="featurette-heading aos-init" style="padding-top: 2rem;">User Need Analysis</h2>
        <div data-aos="fade-up" class="aos-init">
            <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Potential Users</h6>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" class="aos-init">Potential Evo users are the group of people who have a potential
                interest in using the Evo
                car-sharing services but have never tried it out. Most of the potential users are also first-time
                users of a car-sharing program. The major tasks they would accomplish on the app are
                registering an account, completing the driver's license information, searching for an Evo car
                nearby, and booking a car. We also expect that potential users would seek customer support and
                other forms of helpful information when needed. An intuitive and navigable onboarding
                experience is critical for potential users to build up their mental model and quickly adapt to the
                Evo app.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-aos="fade-up" class="aos-init">
            <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Infrequent Users</h6>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" class="aos-init">Infrequent users are defined as Evo users who have used the Evo
                car-sharing service a couple of
                times but only visit back to the app again for specific purposes. We expect that most infrequent
                users do not see car-sharing as their primary means of transportation. The major tasks infrequent
                users would accomplish on the app are signing in to the account, booking a car, and looking for
                specific information like billing, parking, and refueling. Different from potential users,
                infrequent users have already built up their mental models of using the Evo app but they are far
                from being an expert on the functionality and navigation of the app. Even a small usability pitfall
                would hurt their satisfaction, cause confusion, and possibly lead them to forge the use of the app.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-aos="fade-up" class="aos-init">
            <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Frequent or Loyal Users</h6>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" class="aos-init">Frequent or loyal users are the groups of people who prefer using Evo
                car-sharing services on a
                frequent basis. We expect that many of the frequent or loyal users consider Evo as one of their
                primary modes of transportation. The major tasks they would accomplish on the app are booking
                a car, exploring new features, and contacting customer service for help. As they have already
                established a level of experience navigating the Evo app, frequent or loyal users would expect
                some shortcuts to skip unnecessary information and speed up the interactions.</p>

            <h2 data-aos="fade-up" class="featurette-heading aos-init" style="padding-top: 2rem;">Competitor Analysis
            </h2>
            <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Method and Process</h6>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" class="aos-init">Based on the stated mission, goals, objectives, and the identified
                potential user groups of our
                mobile application, our team began the competitor analysis by identifying existing
                applications that provide similar services. We found that there are numerous apps in the
                transportation industry providing mobility service, but there are significantly fewer options for
                local users (British Columbians) who want to flexibly pick up and drop off cars in different
                locations. Since Evo is focused on a shared vehicle network in BC, we looked for four relatively
                widely-used competitor apps that provide mobility services. We selected two apps that are also
                focused on car-sharing services as our direct competitors and two indirect competitors that offer
                a slightly different product but target a similar audience.</p>

                    <p>Product reviews are one of the most thorough and useful sources of insider information about the
                        customer and user experience, which could be used to debug the current product and initiate new
                        feature designs (Dye, 2021). Our team looked into 49 user reviews on the Evo Car Share mobile
                        application to gauge Evo customers’ perspectives on what usability issues to focus on and how to
                        improve the user experience. The goal of the review analysis is to transform the unstructured
                        qualitative data into structured findings that lead to a better understanding of Evo's current
                        product offering and prepare us for the usability study.</p>
                    <p>We decided to study the user reviews on the App Store because it’s one of the most commonly
                        adopted app distribution channels for phone users. We determined the time frame for data
                        collection to be from September 1, 2022, to October 12, 2022, which is the date of research.
                        This
                        has helped us to narrow down the focus to current reviews and avoid spending unnecessary time
                        looking into outdated reviews that could be already noticed and addressed by the Evo operations
                        team. We copied and pasted each review into a sticky note on Miro for further visualization
                        analysis.</p>

                <li><b>Users love Evo:</b> 10 out of 49 reviews express their interest and gratitude for Evo’s
                    reliable and functional car-sharing services. This is supported by user reviews like “Much
                    improved over previous versions. Daily user who appreciate the speed improvements and
                    increased stability” and “Evo makes it easy to hop in a car for short trips”.</li>
                <li style="padding-top: 1rem;"><b>Users want to use Evo as long as the information on the app is clear
                        and intuitive:</b> 22
                    out of 49 user reviews address the need for a simple and clear interface. Evo users are
                    looking for functionality that allows them to see other available cars on the map even
                    after booking. Users mention “I dislike that once you book a car, you are no longer to see
                    if a closer available one pops up” and “Now it's time to add a notification function that let
                    me know when there is new car near me in specific distance I set”. Users are also looking
                    for more information about the trip details and the location of the car. One of the reviews
                    says, “Cars are often not where they say they are… App often shows no cars anywhere or
                    just crashes mid booking.” The user reviews also convey the importance of the
                    availability and transparency of safety and hygiene information to the users, where one of
                    the reviews says, “[For safety check-in feature on the app] It is particularly difficult to
                    comprehend what damage one is seeing in a photo relative to the automobile because of
                    how they show up on the thumbnail page”.</li>

                    users have
                    complained about the information overload on the Evo app, which overwhelms their
                    minds, drains judgemental ability, affects their focus while driving, and makes their
                    experience frustrating. Users point out that “There is so many buttons to click now. I just
                    want to get in the car and leave” and “LOL at Evo thinking people actually look at the
                    million damage pics for 10 minutes on their dime before they drive”. Two users address
                    their challenges with finding available cars nearby due to limited coverage. One of them
                    says, “I enjoy the whole program. They just need more cars”.</li>
                <li style="padding-top: 1rem;"><b>Users think Evo do need make some changes:</b> 15 out of 49 users show
                    their dissatisfaction with the Evo app because
                    of the recurring technical glitches. This is supported by “If this app worked the way it
                    was intended even 50% of the time I'd give it 5 stars”, “Cars are awesome, app really
                    glitchy”, and “Happened with me more that once, the app block and didn't finish the trip,
                    this should be fix”.</li>

                <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Method and Process</h6>
                <p>We conducted a usability study on 6 people through convenience sampling. The goal of the
                    usability study is to investigate the ease of access and use of the Evo Car Share mobile
                    application. The study consists of two parts, including a user test followed by a short
                    semi-structured interview</p>


                <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Finding</h6>
                <li style="padding-top: 1rem;">There was no correlation between participants' fluency with the software
                    and their
                    familiarity with the technology. Because there is not a massive difference in how quickly
                    people get tasks done, whether they use mobile Apps for an hour or five hours a day.</li>
                <li style="padding-top: 1rem;">When asking for tasks, we find that all participants are trying to finish
                    the task on the
                    homepage. Especially when asking about parking tips, participants are more likely to
                    zoom in on the map to find clues.
                </li>
                <li style="padding-top: 1rem;"> There is too much information on the Menu page, and some icons used are
                    confusing. For
                    example, "My credits" has a clock icon, "Billing" has a wallet icon, and "Evo extras" has
                    a money icon. It is hard to tell the difference between a wallet and a money icon.
                </li>
                <li style="padding-top: 1rem;">The App should not show all cars available for users. We observed that
                    users would only
                    select cars near their current location, while cars in other locations were utterly
                    redundant.
                </li>
                <li style="padding-top: 1rem;">The position of the filter button is not apparent, four participants
                    never used this function,
                    and one participant said he did not see it.
                </li>
                <li style="padding-top: 1rem;">The sign-in process takes too much time, and the expression of the
                    question is unclear,
                    such as "Is your driver's license address the same as your mailing address?". When the
                    participant fills in the checkmark, the App asks for the address again, which is
                    contradictory.

                <h2 class="featurette-heading" style="padding-top: 2rem;">Major Findings</h2>
                <p>Based on the results from our Competitor Analysis, Review Analysis, and Usability Study, we
                    identified four major findings about common user needs and the app features that best support
                    users. Here’s the summary of user need analysis:</p>
                <li style="padding-top: 1rem">Since an increasing number of users prefer one-way point-to-point car
                    rentals, valuing its
                    convenience and ease of use, Evo should continue to provide a one-way point-to-point
                    car sharing service, helping users to achieve a streamlined and integrated experience.
                    Besides, in order to meet users’ diverse needs and preferences, Evo is expected to vary
                    the types and models of its fleet to provide users with more choices in selecting cars and
                    improve the hygiene and safety of their fleets. Additionally, due to the common user need
                    for one-way point-to-point car rentals, Evo can expand their service beyond BC to cover
                    more cities.</li>
                <li style="padding-top: 1rem">Regarding information and interaction, Evo should follow the principle of
                    minimalist
                    design, providing all critical resources and reducing the amount of unnecessary
                    information. Specifically, car location information and instructions for users to find them,
                    trip records and car using tips (like parking, refueling), help information, and first-user
                    instructions are necessary, all of which should be provided in detail. Besides, in order to
                    avoid language or icon misunderstanding, information and instructions should be
                    communicated using daily, proper, plain, and clear language. Further, with the intention
                    of reducing information overload, information should also be organized in an intuitive,
                    logical, accessible, and more easily-findable way. Moreover, critical interaction features
                    such as key shortcuts and buttons should be included and presented in a clear and
                    well-organized way, demonstrating to users a clear, direct, and easy-to-learn approach.
                    Last but not least, Evo should shorten their registration process, and require less
                    registration information at the beginning, in case of irritating and losing prospective
                    users.</li>

                <li style="padding-top: 1rem">In terms of the aesthetic design of the user interface, theme color, font
                    style and size, and
                    icons should be kept consistent in all pages and areas, and conform to most conventions
                    in mobile apps. Considering the heterogeneity of the demographics in BC in ages and
                    backgrounds, information needs and behaviors, information literacy, and technology
                    experience, Evo is expected to give more choices and freedom for users to customize the
                    21
                    app according to their needs, preferences, and scenarios, which will enhance the
                    flexibility and efficiency in user experience.</li>
                <li style="padding-top: 1rem">The last major finding is about technological glitches and system errors,
                    which are
                    complained about by many users in ratings and reviews. These complaints echo our
                    heuristic evaluation in the competitor analysis and usability study, such as missing icons,
                    confusing functions, unresponsive buttons, mismatch of buttons and pages, etc. Evo
                    should eliminate any technological glitch and system error once they identify or receive
                    criticism as soon as possible, in either the redesign stage or later maintenance and
                    improvement stage, which is necessary and critical to enlarge their user group, improve
                    user loyalty, and achieve high recognition in a wide range of areas in the long run.</li>

                <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Current Information Architecture</h6>
                <p>The current information architecture of the Evo Car Share app
                    compromises 3 major sections, including “find a ride”, “my bookings”, and “menu”. The current
                    information architecture is function-oriented and mutually exclusive in terms of the actions
                    intended. We consider it an appropriate and effective way to categorize the tasks and help the
                    users to find a particular action or service they would like to proceed with.</p>

                <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Methods and Process</h6>
                <p>We conducted an open card sorting test with 10 participants to investigate the labeling and
                    grouping issues with the current Evo interface and potential ways to redesign it. An online
                    software called Optimal Sort was used to allow participants to sort cards independently on their
                    own computers. Participants were asked to categorize cards into groups that make sense to them
                    and label each group with an ideal group name. We decided to use an open card sorting method
                    primarily because we were interested in 1) the degree to which different users would create
                    similar groups of cards, and 2) how users might label these groups. We considered that these two
                    questions would be critical to help us to redesign user-centered global and local navigation menu
                    labels.</p>
                <p>We created 24 cards, each representing an item of content on the menu page. These content items
                    were identified by our content assessment of the current app, supplemented or adapted based on
                    the findings of the competitor analysis and user research in part 1. The following lists out the
                    cards.</p>
                <img data-aos="fade-up" class="image aos-init" src="img/evocarshare/cards.jpg" alt="Evocarshare"
                    width="100%" height="auto" style="padding-top: 1rem;">
                <p style="padding-top: 1rem;">We recruited 10 participants to perform an open card sort of the 24 cards
                    using the card sorting
                    tool Optimal Sort. The card sorting exercise took the 10 participants a median time of 5 minutes
                    and 8 seconds to complete the study. The longest time was 30 minutes and 13 seconds. The
                    shortest time was 2 minutes and 7 seconds. And the 10 participants created a total of 48
                    categories, with a median of 5 categories each.</p>
                <h6 style="text-decoration: underline;">Analysis and Results</h6>
                <p>Once the card sorting was completed, we standardized the results as recommended by Optimal
                    Workshop. This involved “merging”, for purposes of our analysis, categories generated by
                    respondents that were conceptually similar, such as ”FAQ”, “Q &amp;A”, “Questions &amp;
                    Instructions”
                    and “General Question”. This standardization helps when exploring the degree to which different
                    users would sort cards into conceptually-similar groups regardless of label names.</p>
                <p>After the standardization process was complete, we reviewed the dendrograms (Best merge
                    method) (Figure 1) and similarity matrix (Figure 2) visualizations provided by the Optimal Sort
                    software, which illustrates the card sorting results and indicates that some labels should be
                    grouped together based on wide consensus.</p>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>We decided on the “best merge method dendrogram” instead of the “actual agreement method
                    dendrogram (skeptical dendrogram)”. The “best merge method” makes assumptions about larger
                    clusters based on individual pair relationships, which often performs better than the actual
                    agreement method when the study has fewer participants. Since we only had 10 participants, the
                    best merge method dendrogram is more appropriate than the “actual agreement method
                    dendrogram” which works best with 30 or more participants and depicts only absolutely factual
                    relationships.</p>
                <p>According to the results from the dendrograms (best merge method) and similarity matrix as well
                    as the labeling and grouping of the redesigned information architecture of the menu page, we
                    revised its original information architecture. After merging the cards “Parking related questions”
                    and “Parking tips” as one card “Parking tips &amp; questions”, the 30 labels (the 23 cards in 7
                    groups) are as follows:</p>

                <p>Based on the findings from card sorting, we have created the redesigned information architecture as
                    follows</p>
                <img src="img/evocarshare/redesignedIA.png" width="100%" height="auto">
                <h6 style="text-decoration: underline; padding-top: 1rem;">Global and Local Navigation</h6>
                <p>Global navigation on the Evo app is represented by the bottom navigation bar where users can
                    tap to access the primary pages of the App, including "Find a ride", "My bookings", and "Menu".
                    It shows users where they are, where they can go, and how they can get there. To navigate
                    between sections within a page, local navigations, including filters and back buttons, are
                    provided for users to select a piece of particular information and return to the previous stage.</p>
                <p>Evo’s navigation meets the principle of consistency. The location of the bottom navigation bar
                    does not change when users switch to other pages on the app. Additionally, there is interaction on
                    each bottom navigation tab. For example, when the user taps on a navigation tab, the color of the
                    tab will be highlighted to inform the change in the system status. As for local navigation, on the
                    "Find a ride" page, there are two function buttons at the top right corner to help users sort and
                    find the vehicle they are looking for. On the "Menu" page, the local navigation contains 9 pages
                    to help users find the help and documentation information they need.</p>
                <p> We decided to keep using the original typography and color palette for the redesign to ensure the
                    consistency of Evo’s branding. We planned to redesign the local navigation on the home page
                    12
                    based on the usability testing feedback. Moreover, we planned to replace the "see
                    vehicle list" icon button with a drag-down overlap above the map view for more smooth and
                    intuitive interaction.</p>
                <h6 style="text-decoration: underline; padding-top: 1rem;">Labeling and Grouping</h6>
                <p>In the redesign stage, we would like to maintain the internal consistency of labeling with Evo’s
                    branding while making a couple of adjustments to the grouping of information. The iconic labels
                    used in the bottom navigation bar and menu items help to provide consistent and easily
                    understandable content for inexperienced users and provide an aesthetically appealing visual
                    experience. The icons used on Evo’s interface reflect their real-world counterparts and are fast to
                    recognize at a glance. For example, the icon of a magnifying glass is to represent the “Find a
                    ride” function and the icon of a calendar is to represent the “My bookings” function. For most
                    other clickable labels on the app, we decided to use text-based navigation tabs and buttons to
                    streamline users’ browsing experience and improve the readability of the content-heavy menu
                    page.</p>
                <p>As informed by the card sorting findings, we updated the grouping of information categories on
                    the “Menu” page to match the system’s conceptual model with the users’ mental model. We
                    believed the level of agreement within the participants’ grouping indicates an optimal way to
                    categorize different sections within pages and determine the information hierarchy. For example,
                    the number of text buttons on the “Menu” screen has now converged from 9 to 7 categories. And
                    some of the information like “parking tips” are placed in a lower hierarchy under the “FAQ”
                    category to reflect the hierarchical relationship from a broad group of information to a specific
                    topic of information. The order of the categories has altered as well. Inspired by the app interface
                    of Uber, we planned to increase the button size of "FAQ" and "Billing" and have them placed in
                    the first row of the menu. This is because we would like to ensure users are able to locate the
                    most important information in the first place when they open up the menu page for help and
                    assistance. Another design consideration we decided to make is moving the “call for help” button
                    away from “contact us”, because usability testing has informed us that participants get confused
                    about which button to click on when they need roadside assistance.</p>

                <h6 style="text-decoration: underline; padding-top: 1rem;">Processes</h6>
                <p>Since high-fidelity prototypes have many disadvantages (i.e. time-consuming, designers resisting
                    changes), we decided to sketch the low-fidelity prototype using paper and pencil as our first
                    prototype in the iterative design process. Low-fidelity prototyping like paper and pencil
                    prototyping enabled the design team to focus on the structure, functions, and features of the app.
                    It is also time and cost-saving, fast to implement, and easier to change and recreate regarding
                    some specific features or the whole prototypes, which has more potential to increase the number
                    of possible iterations than high-fidelity prototypes.</p>
                <p>Taking into consideration the useful information gathered in the previous research that informs
                    the redesigned information organization, we created and annotated our pencil and paper
                    prototypes by walking through the steps needed to complete the 6 user task scenarios designed in
                    part 1. When considering these paper prototypes for 6 user task scenarios together, they are broad
                    enough to cover most of the features and functions of the app. When presented separately, they
                    are also complete and in-depth enough to evaluate the selected features and functions in each
                    task scenario, which balanced the advantages of vertical and horizontal prototyping.</p>

                <p>After completing the paper prototype, our team decided to use Figma to collaboratively complete
                    our mid-fidelity prototype. In order to ensure the consistency of the design and the similarity to
                    the original App, we unified the color code of the App, which are blue (#54B9DE), gray
                    (#BCC1C2), and black (#000000). We also applied a font similar to the App: Robot Flex for the
                    title and Commissioner for the body. In addition, we also collected the logo of the Evo car share
                    through Photoshop's matting function and then placed the logo at the top of the registration
                    screen. We also searched free licensed SVG files for each icon using Google. After setting up
                    everything, it took us about 5 days to finish the prototype.</p>
                <p>In order to provide a better testing experience for usability participants, we connected all pages
                    to ensure that the prototype was usable. Then, we invited two of our friends who are UI
                    designers to test the prototype and made some changes based on their feedback.</p>
                <p>The mid-fidelity prototype is presented as follows:</p>

                <h6 style="text-decoration: underline; padding-top: 1rem;">Methods and Processes</h6>
                <p>We conducted a usability study on 5 people who had been conveniently sampled to do the
                    usability test in part 1. The usability study aimed to investigate the ease of access and use of the
                    Evo Car Share redesign of the mobile application. We developed a user testing protocol to ensure
                    that we can get the best information from the study. The user testing
                    consisted of a user test and a short semi-structured interview. The process is similar to the
                    previous one in Part 1. The only difference is that we did not book the study room for the tester
                    this time. Instead, we asked our participants to do the test through Zoom, and they were given a
                    prototype link to do the test on their computers. In order to see the difference in user behavior
                    between using the redesigned app and the original app, the tasks given to participants are the
                    same as the ones created in part 1. Meantime, we recorded the testing process and their behavior
                    on the app for future analysis.</p>

                <h6 style="text-decoration: underline; padding-top: 1rem;">Conclusion</h6>
                <p>Compared with the Part 1 Usability test, we found that the user spent much less time on each
                    page when completing each task than in the first test. Plus, everyone made fewer mistakes and
                    asked fewer questions during the test than before. Regarding the “find a ride” page, we realize
                    that instruction is needed when introducing a new or updated function to the user. It is also
                    significant to provide feedback when users complete the vehicle rental. In this case, we accepted
                    our participant’s advice, creating a notification window when the vehicle is reserved. As for the
                    “Menu” page, we decided to keep the redesigned layout since 80% of participants are used to
                    this pattern. In general, all participants said that they preferred the redesigned user interface
                    because it tremendously improved the user experience of this App. Moreover, most people
                    thought the “Menu” page was more straightforward and intuitive than the original one.</p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading" style="padding-top: 2rem;">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The major challenge encountered when it comes to redesigning the existing Evo mobile interface
                    is not reinventing the wheel while maintaining internal consistency with Evo’s branding. We
                    29
                    took into consideration the typography, color palette, and other design patterns used on the
                    current interface to make sure the consistency of the visual experience throughout the redesigned
                    version. We also studied design guidelines like the iOS’ Human Interface Guidelines and Web
                    Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to create a compelling design with the support of
                    intuitiveness, usefulness, accessibility, and consistency. Another problem we countered is the
                    constraint of time, which limited the sample size of our research participants. We admitted that
                    the lack of diverse samples may bias the research results and impact the design outcome. The
                    convenience sampling strategy we used to source participants for the usability study and user
                    testing cannot fully represent the entire population of Evo users. The conclusion of the research
                    results thus lacks clear generability.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p>The perceived success for our team is the deliverable of a mid-fidelity prototype. While it’s
                            not
                            highly functional like a high-fidelity prototype or a coded product, it meets the need for
                            user
                            testing and has helped us to collect valuable input for future iterations. The design also
                            succeeds
                            in providing a simple and navigable account registration process with a progress bar and
                            clear
                            instructions on the steps. The redesign of the menu screen better supports novice and
                            infrequent
                            users to locate the help information from a cluster of buttons. While the swiping overlap to
                            switch between the map view and list view is successful, a shortcoming we noticed from the
                            user
                            testing is that this function may not be noticeable to inexperienced users. Although we had
                            an
                            iOS default overlay grabber on the top of the overlap to indicate potential interactions,
                            users who
                            have less experience with digital technology and iOS interfaces may have a hard time
                            understanding the meaning. Therefore, we later decided to add a coach mark for
                            first-time users to aid them in learning how to swipe between the map view and the list
                            view.
                            Based on other feedback we got, we would also like to provide a clearer indication of the
                            difference between “call for help” and “contact us” to reduce user friction while looking
                            for the
                            help information. A potential way to reword “contact us” to “about us”.</p>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>If we had more time, we would like to go more vertical in the prototype design to create a full
                    product experience for user testing. This could require more tasks to design. For instance,
                    possible sections and tasks to add include the sign-in process for registered users, trip canceling,
                    safety check-in, and stopover process. Although some of the tasks are not addressed by our
                    30
                    primary personas, those are still critical for Evo users to complete their trips. We also learned
                    through user testing that push notification is an important interaction to alert users of system
                    status and possible actions to take. If we had more time for this project, we could possibly create
                    a push notification design to inform users that the vehicle booking is successful after hitting the
                    confirm button.</p>
                <p>The most problematic stage of the design lifecycle is the transition between each design phase,
                    which is about defining the appropriate scope for the next steps. For example, we struggled with
                    a large number of qualitative data sets during user research to determine what user needs should
                    be prioritized considering the time and resources constraint of this project. It took us a lot of
                    time
                    to scope down the user personas and task scenarios due to the number of data points. If time
                    permits, we would like to fully utilize design thinking and double diamond models to explore
                    issues more widely and narrow down the actions quickly. Another stage we felt was problematic
                    is the ideate phase which requires a lot of brainpower and design experience to produce potential
                    design elements. We enjoyed the creative process of transforming the written design requirement
                    into a paper and pencil prototype towards the end of this project.</p>
                <p>The most important lesson learned through this project is being agile. We were used to
                    waterfall-like projects where milestones and deliverables were set in stone at the beginning of the
                    project. However, our team went through numerous rounds of iterations to refine the scope,
                    better understand the user needs, and make the design polished. For future projects, more time
                    could be spent continuously testing out the concept and making adjustments to the design. We
                    believe that the iterative design approach could help to provide robust user feedback, build rapid
                    evolution of design, and experiment with a large variety of ideas.</p>
